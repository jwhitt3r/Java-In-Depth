# Mental Workflows When Developing Code

## Programming Workflow:

### 1. Understand the Problem:
- **Programming Terminology:** Problem statement, requirements.
- **Definition:** Gain a clear understanding of what the program is expected to accomplish.
- **Example:** Calculate the area of a rectangle.

### 2. Plan Your Solution:
- **Programming Terminology:** Class design, method definition.
- **Definition:** Outline the structure and functionality of your solution.
- **Example:** Design a `Rectangle` class with methods to calculate area.

### 3. Define Components (Shapes):
- **Programming Terminology:** Class.
- **Definition:** Identify the main building blocks or entities in your solution.
- **Example:** Identify the `Rectangle` class as the main shape.

### 4. Specify Actions (Behaviors):
- **Programming Terminology:** Methods, behaviors.
- **Definition:** Define the actions or operations your components can perform.
- **Example:** Define methods like `setDimensions` and `calculateArea`.

### 5. Build Your Solution:
- **Programming Terminology:** Implementation.
- **Definition:** Write the actual code to create the solution.
- **Example:** Implement the `Rectangle` class in Java.

### 6. Test Your Code:
- **Programming Terminology:** Testing, test cases.
- **Definition:** Verify that your code behaves as expected in various scenarios.
- **Example:** Write test cases to ensure `Rectangle` methods work correctly.

### 7. Review and Simplify:
- **Programming Terminology:** Refactoring.
- **Definition:** Review and improve your code without changing its functionality.
- **Example:** Refactor code for clarity or efficiency.

### 8. Combine and Check:
- **Programming Terminology:** Integration testing.
- **Definition:** Check interactions within the components of your solution.

### 9. Document Your Code:
- **Programming Terminology:** Documentation.
- **Definition:** Explain your code, making it understandable for others.

### 10. Get Feedback and Improve:
- **Programming Terminology:** Code review, feedback loop.
- **Definition:** Seek input from others, review the code, and make improvements.


# Problem-Solving Workflow
### 1. Read and Summarize:
- Quickly read and summarize the problem, focusing on key elements.

### 2. Define Inputs/Outputs and Identify Patterns:
- Clearly define the expected format of inputs and outputs.
- Work through quick examples to understand problem dynamics and identify patterns.
- Clarify your understanding by considering different scenarios.

### 3. Break It Down:
- Break the problem into smaller sub-problems or tasks.
- Focus on solving one piece at a time.

### 4. Start Simple:
- Implement a basic version for a straightforward case.
- Gradually enhance complexity as you validate each part.

### 5. Test, Refactor, and Iterate:
- Test your solution incrementally with various cases.
- Refactor your code to improve clarity, efficiency, or other aspects.
- Iterate and refine your solution as needed.

### 6. Go Back to Break It Down:
- Revisit the problem breakdown stage.
- Identify new insights or considerations.

# Worked Example
## Original 10-Step Programming Workflow:

### 1. Understand the Problem:
- We want to create a program that represents a rectangle and calculates its area.

### 2. Plan Your Solution:
- We plan to create a `Rectangle` class with appropriate attributes and methods to calculate the area.

### 3. Define Components (Shapes):
- Identify the main shape, which is the `Rectangle` class.

### 4. Specify Actions (Behaviors):
- Define behaviors, such as methods to set dimensions and calculate the area.

### 5. Build Your Solution:
- Implement the `Rectangle` class with the defined behaviors.

### 6. Review and Simplify:
- Review the code for clarity and simplicity. Refactor if necessary.

### 7. Test Your Code:
- Write test cases to ensure the `Rectangle` class behaves as expected.

### 8. Combine and Check:
- Check interactions within the `Rectangle` class.

### 9. Document Your Code:
- Document the `Rectangle` class, explaining its purpose and usage.

### 10. Get Feedback and Improve:
- Seek feedback from peers, review the code, and make improvements as needed.

## Problem-Solving Workflow Integration:

### 1. Read and Summarize:
- Read the problem, focusing on creating a rectangle class to calculate area.

### 2. Define Inputs/Outputs and Identify Patterns:
- Define that the input is the dimensions of the rectangle, and the output is the calculated area.
- Identify patterns, such as the need for length and width attributes.

### 3. Break It Down:
- Break down the problem into creating a class, defining attributes, and implementing methods for area calculation.

### 4. Start Simple:
- Implement a basic version of the `Rectangle` class with minimal features.

### 5. Test, Refactor, and Iterate:
- Test the basic version, refactor for clarity or improvements, and iterate if necessary.

### 6. Go Back to Break It Down:
- If needed, revisit the problem breakdown to enhance or extend the functionality.

## Java Code Example:

Here's a simplified example of the `Rectangle` class in Java:

```java
public class Rectangle {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    // Constructor
    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    // Method to calculate area
    public double calculateArea() {
        return length * width;
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public double getLength() {
        return length;
    }

    public void setLength(double length) {
        this.length = length;
    }

    public double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    public void setWidth(double width) {
        this.width = width;
    }

    // Additional methods can be added as needed
}
