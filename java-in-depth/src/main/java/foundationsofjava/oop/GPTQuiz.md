Can you test me on the definitions of my understanding of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Please can you only say something if I get them right

ChatGPT
Sure, I'd be happy to help. Go ahead and provide your definitions for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. I'll let you know if they are correct.

Encapsulation is about hiding the information and inner workings of a class into itself and providing a contract to interact with the class via its methods.

Inheritance is about defining a class hierarchy with a superclass which contains the generic state and behaviour that is common across all of its subclasses

Polymorphism takes the superclass and allows the creation of all of its subclasses to work as the objects to a superclass reference type.

By enabling these three principles program complexity is reduced, code reuse is maximised, and code scalability is achieved respectively.

You got all three definitions right! Great job!

Encapsulation: Hiding the information and inner workings of a class into itself and providing a contract to interact with the class via its methods.

Inheritance: Defining a class hierarchy with a superclass that contains generic state and behavior common across all of its subclasses.

Polymorphism: Allowing objects of subclasses to be treated as objects of a superclass, achieved through methods such as method overriding.

Your explanations also highlight the benefits of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in terms of reducing program complexity, maximizing code reuse, and achieving code scalability. Well done!
