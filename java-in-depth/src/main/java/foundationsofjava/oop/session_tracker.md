## Notes and Reflection

- **Challenges Faced:** Writing the unit tests takes some time. I also seem to get distracted with my second monitor when focusing. With regards to the video content it is worth reviewing the Q/A of the video, there are one or two mistakes.
- **Break Activities:** Reviewed the notes from the previous session and distracted myself with making tea
- **Overall Reflection:** Writing content down via a physical medium has helped structure my thoughts, it has also allowed me to tie elements back to one another. It is worth noting that picking the video course for particular elements has been quite useful and less overbearing. The oracle documentation regarding Java is suprising good. It is quite valuable to encapsulate this into the learning material as reading documentation for the language is an important aspect of programming.
