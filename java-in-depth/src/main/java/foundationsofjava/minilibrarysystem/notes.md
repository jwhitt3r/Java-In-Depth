# Week [1]: [OOP]

## Key Concepts

- **Objectives:** Create a small library system

- **Core Concepts:**
    - Class hierarchies
    - Collections of relatable objects based on a super class

## Hands-On Practice

- **Code Snippets:**
   N/A

- **Projects:**
    - A book is defined as the super class and varying genres can inherit from it along for suitable class hierarchy
    - Collections of relatable books can be established within the library based on genre

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenges:**
    - N/A

- **Solutions:**
    - N/A

## Reflection

- **What Went Well:**
    - Class hierarchies have become easier to understand as they are based on relationships

- **Areas for Improvement:**
    - N/A

## Additional Resources

- **Reading Materials:**
    - Object Orientated Design is something that should be reviewed as part of any development learning program

## Future Focus

- **Key Takeaways:**
    - Think about how the classes are structured and how a class may inherit or be composed of one another

- **Next Steps:**
    - Review generics to understand how this could improve the library

## Personal Notes

- **Personal Observations:**
    - It has been fun combining my knowledge together with some small but extensible

- **Questions:**
    - How does generics improve readability and flexibility
